A simple GUI app that displays a HUD (Heads-Up Display) on the screen. 
It is intended to be used during indoor cycling on top of other full screen apps or in addition to watching youtube videos.

# Disclaimer
This is a hobby project and my first GUI app. It is not guaranteed to be accurate or reliable. Use at your own risk.
